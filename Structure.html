				<header> What type of hacking Google is suffuring ? </header> 
				<article>
					<p>There are different types of security attacks that can affect Google users and Google services themselves. Here are some examples: </p>
					<ol>
  					    <li>Phishing:
    					    <ol>
      					        <li>This is a fraud technique that involves sending fraudulent emails or text messages that mimic the appearance of legitimate Google messages to attempt to steal login credentials or other sensitive data.</li>
    					    </ol>
  					    </li>
  					    <li>Brute force attacks:
    					    <ol>
      					        <li>This involves using software to try to guess passwords by trying many different combinations until the right one is found.</li>
    					    </ol>
  					    </li>                
                        <li>Denial-of-service attacks (DDoS):
    					    <ol>
      					        <li>This is an attack that aims to make a Google service unavailable by flooding the service with a large number of requests.</li>
    					    </ol>
  					    </li>
						<li>Software vulnerability attacks:    
    					    <ol>
      					        <li>This involves exploiting known or unknown security flaws in Google software to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or systems.</li>
						       
    					    </ol>
  					    </li>
						<li>Network attacks:    
    					    <ol>
      					        <li>This involves intercepting communications between Google users and Google servers to intercept sensitive data.</li>
    					    </ol>
  					    </li>
					</ol>
					<p>Vulnerabilities in Google's web applications that allow attackers to inject malicious code, such as SQL injections, XSS injections, command injections, client-side script injections, etc.</p>
					<p>Vulnerabilities in Google's identity and access management systems, which could allow attackers to hijack user accounts or access sensitive data.</p>
					<p>Vulnerabilities in the communication protocols used by Google, such as SSL and TLS, which could allow attackers to intercept or modify data in transit.</p>
					<p>Vulnerabilities in Google's own software, such as the Android operating system, which could allow attackers to execute malicious code or take control of devices.</p>
					<p>Vulnerabilities in security protocols, such as WPA2, which could allow attackers to compromise the security of Wi-Fi networks used by Google users.</p>

					<p> </p>
					<p> </p>

					<p>Code injections such as XML External Entity (XEE) and SQL injections are also common types of security attacks that can affect Google users. Code injections are often used to exploit vulnerabilities in web applications, such as Google applications, to gain access to sensitive data or take control of the application itself.</p>
					<p>XEE injection is an attack that exploits vulnerabilities in XML data processing. It allows an attacker to include external entities in an XML document, which can be used to access system files, steal sensitive data, or perform other malicious actions.</p>
					<p>SQL injection is an attack that exploits vulnerabilities in web applications that use SQL databases to store data. It allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into a query to access, modify, or delete data in the database.</p>
					<p>There are also other types of code injections, such as Command Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) injections, that can also affect Google users.</p>

			<section class = 'main-section' id = 'how_they_do_and_exemple'>
				<header> How they do and exemple ? </header> 
				<article>
					<p>Here are the general steps of a code injection attack:</p>
					<ol>
  						<li>Reconnaissance:
    						<ol>
      							<li>The attacker seeks to identify potential vulnerabilities in Google's web applications or systems using vulnerability scanning techniques such as port scanning, searching for public information on targeted systems, etc.</li>
    						</ol>
  						</li>
  						<li>Exploitation:
    						<ol>
      							<li> Once the attacker has identified a potential vulnerability, they attempt to exploit it using automated tools or by creating custom malware to attack the system.</li>
    						</ol>
  						</li>                
            			<li>Code Injection:
							<link> <img src="images/g-injection.png" alt="Google Injection" width=30% height=30%>
				</link>
				<style>
					img {
					float: right;
					}
					</style>
    						<ol>
      							<li>If the vulnerability allows for code injection, the attacker inserts malicious code into the data sent to the web application or Google's system in order to take control of the application or access sensitive data.</li>
    						</ol>
  						</li>
						<li>Privilege Escalation:
    						<ol>
      							<li>Once an attacker has successfully injected malicious code into the targeted system, they attempt to take control of the system by escalating their privileges. This often involves executing system commands or modifying system files.</li>
    						</ol>
  						</li>
						<li>Concealment:
    						<ol>
      							<li>After successfully taking control of the targeted system, the attacker may attempt to conceal their presence by modifying system logs or deleting evidence of their attack.</li>
    						</ol>
  						</li>
						<li>Backdoor:
							<link> <img src="images/g-backdoor.png" alt="Google BackDoor " width=20% height=20%>
				</link>
				<style>
					img {
					float: right;
					}
				</style>
    						<ol>
      							<li>This step involves installing unauthorized and often hidden access to Google's system to allow hackers to access it at any time in the future without being detected.</li>
								<li>This may include installing malware on Google's servers or on the devices of Google users to allow hackers to gain unauthorized access to these systems. Backdoors can be programmed to activate at certain times, in response to certain events, or using specific keywords so that hackers can access sensitive data or perform malicious actions without being detected.</li>
    						</ol>
  						</li>
						<p>Social engineering is a technique used by attackers to deceive Google users and persuade them to disclose sensitive information or perform malicious actions. This technique can take various forms, such as identity theft, creating fake websites or applications, or sending fraudulent emails.</p>
						<p>For example, attackers can send fraudulent emails to Google users that appear to come from Google or other legitimate sources, such as banks or government services. These emails may contain links to fake websites that look like legitimate sites, but are actually designed to steal users' credentials. Attackers can also use persuasive tactics, such as urgency or fear, to prompt users to disclose sensitive information.</p>
						<p>Social engineering can be an effective method for attackers because it targets users directly rather than the security systems themselves. Users may be less suspicious of emails or messages that appear to come from legitimate sources, and may be more likely to disclose sensitive information or perform malicious actions in response to persuasive tactics.</p>
					</ol>
					<p>Here are some exemple of big attacks that get publicize</p>
					<ol>
						<li>XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):
						  <ol>
								<li>In 2007, an XSS vulnerability was exploited to hack Google. Hackers were able to inject malicious code into Google's search pages, which displayed error messages containing links to malicious sites. This attack was quickly discovered and resolved by Google.</li>
						  </ol>
						</li>
						<li>DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) Attacks:
						  <ol>
								<li> Google has been the target of several DDoS attacks over the years. In 2009, Google's Gmail service was hit by a DDoS attack that made the service inaccessible to many users. In 2017, Google's DNS servers were targeted by a DDoS attack that made several Google services inaccessible to users.</li>

				<p>Most recently vulnerability discovered is (march 2023): </p>
					<ol>
					<p>A zero-day vulnerability has been discovered in Google phones that could allow an attacker to take control of the device with just the phone number. The vulnerability, dubbed "CVE-2022-0391," affects all Android devices with a Qualcomm chipset, which includes most Google phones, such as Pixel and Nexus devices.</p>
					<p>According to researchers from Check Point Research, the vulnerability is due to a flaw in the Qualcomm Mobile Station Modem (MSM) firmware, which is responsible for communication between the phone's processor and cellular networks. By sending a specially crafted SMS message to the device, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain access to the device's memory, allowing them to execute malicious code, steal sensitive data, or even take control of the device remotely.</p>
					<p>What makes this vulnerability particularly concerning is that it doesn't require any interaction from the victim, such as clicking on a malicious link or downloading a file. All an attacker needs is the victim's phone number, which can easily be obtained through various means, including public directories or social engineering tactics.</p>
					<p>Google has released a patch for this vulnerability as part of its April 2023 security update, which users are strongly encouraged to install as soon as possible. However, given the large number of affected devices, it may take some time for the patch to be widely adopted.</p>
